# WordLearner

## Purpose
This project was mainly aimed at learning concepts pertaining to JavaScript and API usage. It allows one to search a dictionary and see a clean presentation of the phonetics and definitions of a given word.
## Future Development
I love language. An application like this is appealing to me, but more features would be necessary to make it useful. A user interface allowing one to log-in, see previously searched terms, and practice using them are all areas of possible development. I may attempt to remake this app with Vue or REACT as well.
